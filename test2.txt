Patch is used for small updations like if we have name,id,number we need to update name we use patch
when we need to update id,name we use put
how to locate table in selenium
can you explain the framework which you have used in your selenium project==
We need to specify in and out of our Test Automation Framework such as programming language used,
 Type of framework used, Test Base Class (Initializing WebDriver, Implicit Waits),
 How we separate Element locators and tests (Page Objects, Page Factory), 
Utility functions file, Property files, TestNG annotations, How we parameterize tests using Excel files, 
How we capture error screenshots, Generating reports(Extent Reports),
 Emailing reports, 
Version Control System used and Continues Integration Tool used
delete-once we delete data from db we can retreive it but in truncate it is not possible .
Exploratory testing vs adhoc
where you used abstraction and encapsulation in automation

OOPs-
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data,
while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

how you use equivalence and boundary value in project==
test plan vs test strategy
test metrics
pageobjectmodel
challenges faced in manual/automation testing


entry criteria-the precondition must be achieved before starting testing process
testplan-
planning-requirement documents
testdesign-
requirment document,test plan
test environment-
testplan,smoke test,test data
test execution-
testplan,testcase,testdata,testenvironment
test closure-
test execution report,defect report
exit criteria-the condition must be met before testing coming to end
testplan-
test strategy,test estimation,test plan
test design-
test case,test script,test data
test environment-
smoke test results
test execution-
testcase execution report,defect report,rtm
test closure-
testclosure report,test metrics


test metrics are used to estimate the progress,productivity,quality of a software testing process.
to improve efficiency of testing porcess,to help make better decisions for further testing process and providing data to the testing process
test metrics are used to take decision for next phase of activities,understand improvement required
