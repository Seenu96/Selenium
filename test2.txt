how to locate table in selenium
can you explain the framework which you have used in your selenium project==
We need to specify in and out of our Test Automation Framework such as programming language used,
 Type of framework used, Test Base Class (Initializing WebDriver, Implicit Waits),
 How we separate Element locators and tests (Page Objects, Page Factory), 
Utility functions file, Property files, TestNG annotations, How we parameterize tests using Excel files, 
How we capture error screenshots, Generating reports(Extent Reports),
 Emailing reports, 
Version Control System used and Continues Integration Tool used
delete-once we delete data from db we can retreive it but in truncate it is not possible .

OOPs-
OOP stands for Object-Oriented Programming.

Procedural programming is about writing procedures or methods that perform operations on the data,
while object-oriented programming is about creating objects that contain both data and methods.

Object-oriented programming has several advantages over procedural programming:

OOP is faster and easier to execute
OOP provides a clear structure for the programs
OOP helps to keep the Java code DRY "Don't Repeat Yourself", and makes the code easier to maintain, modify and debug
OOP makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

test environment-

test execution-

test closure-
test execution report,defect report
exit criteria-the condition must be met before testing coming to end
testplan-
test strategy,test estimation,test plan
test design-
test case,test script,test data
test environment-
smoke test results
test execution-
testcase execution report,defect report,rtm
test closure-
testclosure report,test metrics


test metrics are used to estimate the progress,productivity,quality of a software testing process.
to improve efficiency of testing porcess,to help make better decisions for further testing process and providing data to the testing process
test metrics are used to take decision for next phase of activities,understand improvement required 
process metrics-used to in process of test execution and test preparation phase of stlc
product metrics used in the process of defect anaysis phase in stlc

High severity and low priority:
there is a about us link in home page if we click it becomes blank

High Priority & Low Severity:
A minor issue that imposes some loss of functionality, but for which there is an acceptable & easily reproducible workaround. Testing can proceed without interruption but it affects customers reputation.

For example,
1. Spelling mistake of a company name on the homepage
2. Company logo or tagline issues
 
It is important to fix the issue as soon as possible, although it may not cause a lot of damage.

Low Priority & Low Severity:
For example,
1. FAQ page takes a long time to load.
2. Font family or font size or color or spelling issue in the application or reports (Spelling mistake of company name on the home page wonâ€™t come under this Low Priority and Low
Severity)
